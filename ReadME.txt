#This file contains the descriptions and instructions to run project.
# Description:
Problem 1:
For Problem 1 , we have to implement 7 operations on binary search tree. The operations are implemented using JAVA programming language .
the minimum requirements to run the project is to have JAVA 8 JRE and JDK 1.8 or higher.
The solution uses two classes one is the nested class Node and one class Binary Search Tree . The Node specific properties are defined at Node class.
These properties are used in the binary search tree class to perform operations on the BST. For Balancing, the solution uses AVL tree for self balancing.
the solution also provides all 3 methods 1. Preorder, Postorder,Inorder tree travesal methods.
The solution will also throw an error if the key entered contains any whitespaces.

Problem 2 :
The solution to Problem 2 uses JAVA programming language. The minimum requirements to run the program : JAVA JRE 8 && JDK 1.8 or higher.
The solution uses inheritance to solve the problem 2. The solution displays all the possible moves for a given chess piece.
Initially all the chess pieces are occupying positions from [1a -1h] && [2a-2h] i.e. first two rows. The solution will not display the position which is already occupied.




#Instructions :
1. To run problem 1 solution . Run the BinarySearchTree.java file .
2. To run problem 2 solution . Run the ChessSolver.java file .

#Dependencies 
None.
